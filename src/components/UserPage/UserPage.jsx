        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a dedicated Full-Stack Developer with a rich background in technical and maintenance roles, 
            currently based in [Your Location]. Transitioning from hands-on roles at the City of Saint Petersburg 
            and USA Construction Group, where I developed a keen sense of problem-solving, leadership, and technical 
            proficiency, I've recently completed an immersive coding program at Prime Digital Academy. 
            This program equipped me with expertise in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and other modern web technologies, 
            fueling my passion for building responsive, user-centric applications.
        </p>
        <p>
             My project portfolio includes a vehicle maintenance tracking app and a mental health-focused mobile app,
             demonstrating my capability in full-stack development, client collaboration, and project management. 
             With a toolkit spanning across JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and various development tools, 
             I'm eager to bring my growth mindset, adaptability, and creativity to the tech industry. 
             My aim is to leverage my diverse skills to develop innovative software solutions that make a difference.
